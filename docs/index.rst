Artus : a GeoAI package to produce maps thanks to deep learning
=======================================================

Artus is a python package to automatically produce maps thanks to deep learning models. With artus, you can train deep learning learning models (neural network)
on raster images annotated with vector files. You can then use the trained model to predict spatial occurrences on new unlabeled rasters. Predictions can be exported
to a GeoJson format and uploaded in your favourite GIS software.

To handle large raster file, artus provides a way to tile raster into smaller tiles according to different cutting grids.

Artus has already been implemented in three use cases using 3 differents inputs data : satellite images to detect gillnets vessels, orthomosaics to detect corals
species and underwater images marked with a georeferenced point to detect marine species.

For example, the following map is generated by automatically detecting dead corals on images associated with a single GPS point:

.. image:: heatmap_study_area.png
   :alt: Detection of dead corals on georeferenced images

You can also work directly on raster files (like the following underwater orthomosaics). Because this raster was heavy (more than 1Go) and could not fit in GPU memory, we tiled
into smaller splits with artus and predict corals occurrences thanks to a trained deep learning model:
